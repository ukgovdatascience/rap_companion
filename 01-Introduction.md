# Introduction {#intro}

The [Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)](https://gdsdata.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/) is an alternative production methodology for automating the bulk of steps involved in creating a statistical report.  

The production of a RAP is not a trivial task given technical, time and knowledge limitations within teams who desire to replace traditional and semi-manual methods of statistical report production. We address some of the common knowledge gaps and hard-to-Google problems that upcoming RAP-pers face.  

This [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) manual uses the *eesectors* package to help elucidate the RAP development process. It attempts to amalgamate the learnings of the early pioneers of RAP into a maintained tome of knowledge to ensure good practice is accessible for RAP newbies.  

## Objectives

* Questions to ask oneself before you RAP?  
* Why RAP?  
* How to RAP?
