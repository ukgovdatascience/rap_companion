Reproducible Analytical Pipeline Companion
==========================================

**This is a prototype and subject to constant development**

A technical communication document written using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) intended to give assistance to people developing a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline.  

This document is intended to be RAP community maintained. If you discover any good resources associated with RAP, please contribute to the development of this book by [forking and pulling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_and_pull_model) on [Github](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

See the
[eesectorsmarkdown](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/eesectorsmarkdown)
repository for an example of implementing RAP as an R package in the context
of a Statistical First Release (SFR).
